            I'm a third-year B.Tech CSE student, and I love diving into web development and problem-solving. I'm into Java for cracking problems efficiently and Python for its versatility. Always on the lookout for chances to boost my skills and work on cool projects.

Lately, I've been focusing more on the backend side of things in development. When I'm not coding, you'll find me jamming to music or enjoying a good cup of coffeeâ€”I'm a bit of a coffee fanatic. Let's chat and see if we can team up on some awesome projects!
